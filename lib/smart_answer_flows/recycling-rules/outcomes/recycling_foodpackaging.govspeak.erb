Separate your metal packaging from your plastic packaging. Metal packaging can be recycled but plastic food packaging such as the plastic packs that contain raw chicken and meat can’t be recycled. It’s made from a lower grade of plastic compared to plastic bottles. Put it in the bin with the rest of your household waste.
