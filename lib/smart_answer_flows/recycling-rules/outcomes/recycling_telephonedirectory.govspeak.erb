Telephone directories are produced from a low grade of paper so should not be put into the paper recycling banks. They are collected by JT every year and are sent for specialist recycling. Look out for collection points at schools, offices and post offices.

Or take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 Bellozanne. Thereâ€™s a grey chest collection box on the left as you drive up to the top of the slope.
