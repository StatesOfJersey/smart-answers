You can sell your car online, to a local garage or you could list it on Jersey E-Cycle
Or if youâ€™re looking to scrap your car, the owner of the vehicle must complete the back of the Vehicle Registration Document by ticking the 'scrapped' box, signing and entering the date the vehicle was scrapped in box number one.  Send this document to DVS within seven days.
You can then take the car to the waste metals recycling facility in Bellozanne.
