If your furniture is in good condition you could sell it online, list on Jersey E-Cycle, donate it to charity or give your item to a friend.
If it is still in good working order contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If your furniture is beyond repair take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 Bellozanne.
