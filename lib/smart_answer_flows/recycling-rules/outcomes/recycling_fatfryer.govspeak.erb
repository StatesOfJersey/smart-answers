Fixing your fryer may be cheaper than replacing it. If your item is in warranty it could be fixed for free.

You could make some extra cash by selling it at a car boot or online. You could also list it on Jersey E-Cycle or give the electrical item to a friend.
Or, take the fryer to the Household Recycling Centre in Bellozanne.

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.
 
Let the cooking oil cool down before removing it, put it in an old milk carton or container and take it to Gate 4 where you can empty it into the large container for used cooking oil.
Make sure all the cooking oil is emptied out of the fryer before bringing it with you to the recycling centre.
