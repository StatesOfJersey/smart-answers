Separate glass from your other rubbish, make sure used bottles and jars are clean. Corks are not recyclable and should be put in household waste. Metal lids can be recycled in the metal packaging recycling bank.

All parishes except some areas of St Helier have a glass collection. It may be a monthly or weekly collection, depending on where you live. Check your parish website to find out when your glass will be collected.
