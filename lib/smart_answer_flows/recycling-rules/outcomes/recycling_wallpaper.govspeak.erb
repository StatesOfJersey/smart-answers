If you have left over wallpaper in good condition you could sell it at a car boot, sell it online, give it to a friend or list it on Jersey E-Cycle.

Small amounts of clean, unused wall paper with no glue attached can go into paper recycling. Take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne and ask a member of staff to check the pattern is suitable for recycling.

If the wallpaper is used and has glue and other materials attached, put it in the bin with the rest of your household waste or take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne and use the Household Waste skip.
