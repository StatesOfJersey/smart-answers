Pyrex is sometimes used to make treated glass casserole dishes and other cookware. Because it has been treated it is non-recyclable.
If your pyrex item is in good condition you could sell it online, list on Jersey E-Cycle, donate it to charity or give your item to a friend. 

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes need of your item.

Or wrap it in used newspaper and put it in the bin with the rest of your household rubbish.
