Pass books on to someone else by selling them at car boot sales, give them to a friend or donate them to charity. You can also list them on Jersey E-Cycle.

If you can't reuse them, paperbacks can be recycled in the paper recycling banks.

Hardbacks must have the covers removed before the pages are put into the paper recycling banks. The hardback covers can be recycled in cardboard recycling banks.
