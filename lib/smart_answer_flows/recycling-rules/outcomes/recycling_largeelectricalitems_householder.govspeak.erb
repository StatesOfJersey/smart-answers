If it’s still in good working order you could make some extra cash by selling it at a car boot or online. You could also list it on Jersey E-Cycle or give the electrical item to a friend.
Or you could contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If it’s beyond repair, take your fridges, freezers, portable air conditioning units and other cooling appliances to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 Bellozanne.
