If it’s working you could donate it to charity, sell it online, list it on Jersey E-Cycle or give it to a friend. Make sure you delete your personal data from the device before passing it on to someone else.  

The Welcome Centre next to St Thomas' Church is interested in second hand computers, hard drives and memory cards.  

You could also contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.  

If your item isn’t working take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 in Bellozanne. If your electrical item has a screen, like a computer monitor or a TV, put it in the TV section if the item is electrical, it has a plug but doesn’t have a screen put it in the electrical pile.

Electricals contain chemicals and metals that should not be thrown away in your rubbish.
