Put used catalogues into a paper recycling bin. If you live in St Brelade, St Lawrence and St Mary you can leave paper and catalogues out to be collected by your parish kerbside recycling scheme.

If you live in St Helier, you may get fortnightly kerbside recycling depending on what part of the parish you live in. 

The collection day for kerbside recycling will depend on which parish you live in. You should contact your parish hall for more information.

If you live in a parish that doesn't have a kerbside recycling collection, contact your parish hall to let them know you're interested in recycling.
