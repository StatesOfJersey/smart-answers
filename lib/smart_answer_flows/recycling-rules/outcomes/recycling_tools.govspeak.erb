Fixing your old tools could be cheaper than replacing them. You could sell them online, list it on Jersey E-Cycle, donate it to charity or give your item to a friend.
If the tools are still in good working order contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of them.

Or, take your items to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne. If they are electrical and have a plug, put them in the skip marked ‘electricals’, if the tools are made of metal, put them in the metals skip. If they are made from mixed materials, ask a member of staff for advice.
