Fixing your item may be cheaper than replacing it. If your item is in warranty it could be fixed for free.
If your item is in good condition you could make some extra cash by selling it online, listing it on Jersey E-Cycle or give the electrical item to a friend or a charity. 

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

The Mind Jersey charity shop in New Street accepts electricals in good working order to sell on and make money to help islanders in need.

If itâ€™s broken beyond repair take electrical items to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne. Make sure you remove all batteries from your appliance and recycle these separately.
Electricals contain chemicals and metals that should not be thrown away in your rubbish.
