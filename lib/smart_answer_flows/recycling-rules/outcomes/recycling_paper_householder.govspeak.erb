Newspapers, paper, magazines, sheet paper, shredded paper, greetings cards, envelopes, catalogues and gift wrap (as long as it’s not metallic) call all be recycled. Christmas cards can also be recycled as long as they’re not musical.

Don’t put brown paper, brown envelopes and cardboard into the paper recycle bin, those materials should be put in the cardboard bins.

If you live in St. Brelade, St John, St Lawrence, St Mary or Trinity you can leave cardboard out to be collected by your parish kerbside recycling scheme.  
If you live in St Helier, you may get a kerbside recycling collection depending on what part of the parish you live in.   

The collection day for kerbside recycling will depend on which parish you live in. You should contact your parish hall for more information.

If you live in a parish that doesn't have a kerbside recycling collection, contact your parish hall and let them know that you're interested in recycling.
