You can give your glasses to most opticians for recycling. Contact your optician.  
The household recycling centre at Gate 4, Bellozanne also accepts used spectacles for recycling. Glasses are given to the Lions Club charity who exports them off the island. The used glasses bin is attached to the wall on the left, next to the old telephone directory collection.
