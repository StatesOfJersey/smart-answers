Bulky items like sofas and armchairs aren’t suitable for recycling. If your furniture is in good condition you could sell it online, list on Jersey E-Cycle, donate it to charity or give your item to a friend. 

Don’t remove fire safety labels from your furniture. Many charity shops aren’t able to accept items if the labels are not attached.

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

Or you could take your sofa to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 Bellozanne
