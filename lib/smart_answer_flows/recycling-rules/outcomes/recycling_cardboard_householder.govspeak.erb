You can recycle cardboard boxes, cardboard packaging, brown paper, brown envelopes, empty and flat boxes.
You can’t recycle cartons that contained liquids like milk and juice because they’re lined with a different material. The cardboard you recycle mustn’t include polystyrene or plastic packaging.

If you live in St Brelade, St Lawrence and St Mary you can leave cardboard out to be collected by your parish kerbside recycling scheme.  

If you live in St Helier, you may get a fortnightly kerbside recycling collection depending on what part of the parish you live in. 

The collection day for kerbside recycling will depend on which parish you live in. You should contact your parish hall for more information.

If you live in a parish that doesn't have a kerbside recycling collection, contact your parish hall to let them know you're interested in recycling.
