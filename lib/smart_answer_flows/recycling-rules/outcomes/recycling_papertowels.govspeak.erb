A small amount of paper towel can go into your home composter along with the cardboard tube providing it doesn’t have any meat juice on it. Home composting kits cost £10 and are available from:

• Belles Fleurs Nursery
• Bonny's Country Garden
• Le Quesne's Nurseries
• Longueville Garden Centre
• Ransoms Garden Centre
• St Peter's Garden Centre
• Stanley's at Holme Grown

Or you can put the cardboard tube into cardboard recycling collections and your used paper towels in the bin with the rest of your household waste.
