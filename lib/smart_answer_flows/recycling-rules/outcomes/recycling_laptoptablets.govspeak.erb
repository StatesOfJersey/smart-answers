If your laptop is working, you could donate it to charity, sell it online, list it on Jersey E-Cycle or give it to a friend.

The Welcome Centre next to St Thomas' Church is interested in second hand computers, hard drives and memory cards.

You could also contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If your laptop isnâ€™t working take it to the TVs recycling area at the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 in Bellozanne. Make sure you delete your data before passing it on.
