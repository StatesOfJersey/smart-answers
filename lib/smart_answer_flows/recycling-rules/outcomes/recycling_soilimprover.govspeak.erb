Reuse soil in other parts of your garden, give it to a green-fingered friend or re-pot an old plant to give it more space to grow.
You could also list it on Jersey E-Cycle (see link below).

You can buy locally made soil improver from the Household Green Waste site at La Collette. Buy it loose by filling your own container / bin or you can buy it in 40 litre bags.
