If your computer is working, you could donate it to charity, sell it online or give it to a friend.

The Welcome Centre next to St Thomas' Church is interested in second hand computers, hard drives and memory cards.

You could also contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If your computer equipment isnâ€™t working take it to the TVs recycling area at the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 in Bellozanne. Make sure you delete your personal data from the device before passing it on.
