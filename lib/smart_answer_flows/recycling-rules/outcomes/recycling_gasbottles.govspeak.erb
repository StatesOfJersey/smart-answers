Gas bottles and SCUBA tanks can be tested and reused. There are companies and individuals that carry out SCUBA equipment services in the island. Join the Jersey SCUBA Divers group on Facebook.
If you have a Kosangas bottle contact Jersey Gas to return your old heating cylinder. The company promises to donate money to charity for every used cylinder itâ€™s given.

If your gas canister or SCUBA cylinder is beyond repair and too damaged to reuse, take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne. Tell a member of staff what was in your cylinder and ask them where the best place is to put it.
