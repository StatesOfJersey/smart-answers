If itâ€™s in good working order you could give it to a charity. You could make some extra cash by selling it at a car boot, online or list it on Jersey E-Cycle.  

Or you could contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

Or, take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne. Remove the cover and put the cover in the textile bin, then put the ironing board in the metal recycling skip. You can ask a member of staff for help.
