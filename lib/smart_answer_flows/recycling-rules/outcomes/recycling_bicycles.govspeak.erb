If your bike is in a good condition you could sell it online, give it to a friend or list them on Jersey E-Cycle.

You could also donate your unwanted bicycle to the Jersey England Parent Support Group or Jersey Bereaved Parents Support. The good cause repairs all types of bicycles and sells them to help local families that are going through a difficult time.

Contact the charity on +44 (0) 1534 734988

Other local charities will also accept used bicycles to fix and sell on. Contact the Association of Jersey Charities for more information.
