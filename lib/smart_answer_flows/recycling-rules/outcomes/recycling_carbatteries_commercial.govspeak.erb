Take your used car batteries to the Commercial Recycling Facility in La Collette.
You can take up to three wet cell batteries. You need a Weighbridge Pass to access the facility. It’s next to the bulky waste drop off point around the back of the Energy from Waste incinerator.
Weighbridge pass applications
If you’ve got more than three wet cell batteries contact Jersey scrapyard: Hunts Jersey Ltd
