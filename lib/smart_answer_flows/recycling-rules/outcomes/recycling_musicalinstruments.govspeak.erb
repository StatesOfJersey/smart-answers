If itâ€™s still in good working order you could sell it at a car boot, give it to a friend or list it on Jersey E-Cycle.

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your instrument. It could be used to help budding musicians learn music.

Or if your instrument is beyond repair take it to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne and ask a member of staff which skip to put it in. It will depend on the material it's made out of.
