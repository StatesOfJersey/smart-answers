   Plastic Film / Plastic Tubs and Trays

<% content_for :body do %>
Plastic film, tubs and trays are made from a lower grade of plastic compared to plastic bottles. This means they aren’t recyclable in Jersey. Contact your nearest primary school or nursery to find out if they’re collecting materials for art projects. You could also list the items on Jersey E-Cycle.

If you can't reuse or rehome your plastic tubs and trays, put them in the bin with the rest of your household rubbish.
