You could sell your old phone at a car boot or online, give it to a friend or donate it to charity. Make sure you remove your personal data beforehand.  

The Autism Jersey Boutique, Bath Street, St. Helier accept used mobile phones. Remember to bring the battery and charger too.  

You could also contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If your mobile isnâ€™t working anymore, you can drop it into the used mobile bin at the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 Bellozanne. The bin is attached to the wall on the left at the top of the slope.
