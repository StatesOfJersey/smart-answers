If your television is working you could make some extra cash by selling it at a car boot or online. You could also list it on Jersey E-Cycle or give it to a friend.

If it’s in a good condition contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If it’s not working take it to the TVs recycling area at the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4 in Bellozanne.
