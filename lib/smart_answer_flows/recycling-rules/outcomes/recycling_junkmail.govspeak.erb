If you receive unwanted mail there’s information available on Jersey Citizen’s Advice website to help you take action to stop companies sending you junk mail.

If you’ve received SCAM mail, send it to Jersey Police for free by writing Po Box 500 on the front of the envelope and put it in the nearest post box, you don’t need to attach a stamp. There’s more information online.

Or you can put any unwanted junk mail into paper recycling bin or put it out with your kerbside collection.

If you live in St. Brelade, St John, St Lawrence, St Mary or Trinity you can leave cardboard out to be collected by your parish kerbside recycling scheme.

If you live in St Helier, you may get a fortnightly kerbside recycling collection depending on what part of the parish you live in. 

The collection day for kerbside recycling will depend on which parish you live in. You should contact your parish hall for more information.

If you live in a parish that doesn't have a kerbside recycling collection contact your parish hall and let them know that you're interested in recycling.

Or, take your used paper to your nearest bring bank:
