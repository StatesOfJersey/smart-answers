Local businesses can take up to 10 items of cardboard to the Commercial Recycling Centre in La Collette.

You need a Weighbridge Pass to access the facility (see link below). Itâ€™s next to the bulky waste drop off point around the back of the Energy from Waste incinerator.

If you have more than ten pieces you should take them to Reclamait Ltd, Rue des Pres Trading Estate.
