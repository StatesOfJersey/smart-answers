If they’re in good condition you could sell them online or list it on Jersey E-Cycle.
Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

Or, if your curtains or cushions are in a bad condition take them to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne and put them in the ‘burnables’ pile.
