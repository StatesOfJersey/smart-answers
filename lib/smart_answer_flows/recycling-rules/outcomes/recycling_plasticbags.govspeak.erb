Reuse plastic bags for shopping or lining a small bin in your bathroom or office. You could use it to clear out your car or for clearing up pet waste.
If the plastic is damaged and you’re not able to use the bag again, put it in the bin with the rest of your household rubbish.

Plastic bags are made from a lower grade of plastic compared to plastic bottles. This means they aren’t recyclable in Jersey.
