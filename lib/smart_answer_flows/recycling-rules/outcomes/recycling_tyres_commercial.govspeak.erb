Car tyres can be brought to the Energy from Waste incinerator at La Collette and put into bulky waste. If it’s a large tyre from a tractor or lorry, separate the rubber from the metal frame or rim. Put the rubber into bulky waste and the metal into the metal waste skip.

You will need a Weighbridge Pass to access this facility (see link below).
