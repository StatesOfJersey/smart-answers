If itâ€™s in good condition you could sell it in a car boot or online, list it on Jersey E-Cycle, give it to a friend or donate it to charity.
Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.

If the ceramics are cracked and broken, take them to the Household Recycling Centre, Gate 4, Bellozanne and put them in the non-recyclables skip.
