There are many second hand jewellery shops in Jersey. If your item is in good condition you could sell your jewellery to a shop or sell it online. You could give it to a friend or relative or contact a charity that would be willing to sell it on and use the money for a good cause.

Contact the Association of Jersey Charities to find out if any local good causes are in need of your item.
