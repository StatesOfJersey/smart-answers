BRITA doesn’t offer a recycling service in Jersey. You have to send your used cartridges to the UK. There is a postage fee; the address is on your used filter. If you’d like to see BRITA filter recycling points in Jersey, contact the company using the website address below.

Until water filter recycling points become available, put your used filter in the bin with your household rubbish.
